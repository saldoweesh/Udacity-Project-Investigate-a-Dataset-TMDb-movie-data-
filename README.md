# Udacity-Project-Investigate-a-Dataset-TMDb-movie-data-
In this project, I decided to investigate TMDb movie dataset to address the following questions:  1- What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues?  2- Are movies' profits affected by the month of release ?  The workflow in brief will be : first I will load the data and analyse its characteristics. Furthermore, I will clean the data to be suitable for analysis and visualization. Then I will analyse the processed data and provides some results based on my observation. Mainly, in this project I will focus on numeric features more than text features.

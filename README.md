# Udacity Project : Investigate a Dataset TMDb movie data

In this project, I investigated TMDb movie dataset to address the following questions:  
1- What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues?  
2- Are movies' profits affected by the month of release ?  

The workflow in brief will be : first I will load the data and analyse its characteristics. Furthermore, I will clean the data to be suitable for analysis and visualization. Then I will analyse the processed data and provides some results based on my observation. Mainly, in this project I will focus on numeric features more than text features.

Language: Python 

Libraries:
- numpy 
- pyplot 
- csv 
- pandas
